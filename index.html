        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          These are some of the more interesting web development projects and
          school work I've done. A large portion of these were completed as part
          of my course work at BYUI, but I've also made it a point to keep
          up-to-date with emerging technologies and stacks. Many of these are
          simple learning exercises, or the product of a course or tutorial.

              A basic, pure React page that pulls data from the US Department of
              Educations College Scorecard API. Search for a school on the left,
              click it and navigate through the information on the main view. I
              made this so I could get some experience working in react without
              a full stack framework. You will need a free API key to use it.

        <h2>Game Developer</h2>
        <p>
          I'm not unique in having a love for playing video games; I started on
          the Atari 2600, but really fell in love with the Nintendo
          Entertainment System(NES). I dream in 8 bit. When my family got our
          first computer, an already out of date, low end Packard Bell 286, I
          immediately thought about making games. A transcribed choose your own
          adventure book, number guessing games, etc. Games have always been my
          motivation for me to learn programming, so it would be strange to not
          dedicate some space here. Below are a few small projects I have been
          working on.

              To Space is a quick and dirty Javascript game that displays to an
              HTML canvas element. It's played entirely with a mouse. Just click
              on the screen in the direction you want the rocket to move and try
              to get as high as you can. There are fuel drops along the way to
              help you go farther. Although simple and crude, all of the images
              are original and were made in Inkscape as SVG files.
